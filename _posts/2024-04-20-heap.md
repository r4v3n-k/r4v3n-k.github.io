# Concept

## Priority Queue

A [priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) is an abstract data type similar to a normal queue
except the fact that each element in a priority queue has an associated **priority**.

It only supports **comparable data** because elements with high priority should be popped out of the priority queue before elements with low priority.

How to assign relative priorities to each element:
- Elements enqueued into the priority queue must be able to be ordered in some way either from least to greatest or greatest to least.
- If two elements have the same priority, they are served in the same order in which they were enqueued.

Given an array of numbers, there are usually two types of PQs: Minimum and Maximum
- Minimum PQ serves the smallest element as the highest priority.
- Maximum PQ serves the greatest element as the highest priority.
- In C++, `<queue>` header provides a container adapter [priority_queue](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/priority_queue).
  - Also, it can be customized by a comparator we define.

Elements that are served have the ordered sequence.

{% highlight terminal %}
arr = [1, 8, 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 9, 7, 2]
max_priority_queue = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
min_priority_queue = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
{% endhighlight %}

The PQ mainly provides three operations.
- `peek()` is to read the element with the highest element.
- `poll()` is to pop the element with the highest element out of the PQ. 
- `add()` is to enqueue an element into the PQ.

The priority queue can be implemented by [Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) data structure,
but that is not the only way. This abstract data type can be implemented by a linked list or an array (but they would not give the best time complexity.)

Notice that `PQ != Heap`.

## Heap

A [heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the `heap property`.
- In a min heap, a parent node has smaller key than the keys of its children. So, the key of the root node is the smallest value in the min heap.
  - It is called _"min heap propety"_.
- In a max heap, a parent node has greater key than the keys of its children. So, the key of the root node is the greatest value in the max heap.
  - It is called _"max heap propety"_.

If any parent node in a heap does not order with any of its children or it is not a tree, we can say _"it has a violation of the heap property."_

A common implementation of a heap is a [complete binary tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/complete-binary-tree) in which
- All the leaf nodes should lean towards the left.
- The last leaf node might not have a right sibling (It might not be a full binary tree.)

Let's see the different between a complete binary tree and a full binary tree.

</div>

Heaps are typically constructed **in-place in the same array** where the keys of nodes are stored.

{% highlight terminal %}

    Min Heap:
      arr = [10, 15, 20, 35, 40, 100, 35]

    Max Heap:
      arr = [100, 40, 35, 10, 15, 50, 40]

    arr[0] is the parent of arr[1] and arr[2]. (It is the root node.)
    arr[1] is the parent of arr[3] and arr[4].
    arr[2] is the parent of arr[5] and arr[6].
    ...
    arr[i] is the parent of arr[2*i+1] and arr[2*i+2]

{% endhighlight %}

Instead of a binary heap, [d-ary heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-ary_heap) is helpful to improve time complexity in operations. Then, the indices of children should be $2*i+1$ to $2*i+d$ where $d$ is the maximum number of children per node.

When adding or removing a new node, it needs two operations to keep the heap property.

A new node is added at the last in a heap. `Bubble Up` or `Swim Up` is to switch up a new node with its parent node if the parent node is greater than the node in a min heap or smaller than the node in a max heap. It occurs until the heap satisfies its heap property (or heap invariant).

The node to be removed is first switched up with the last node in a heap. `Bubble Down` or `Sink Down` is that, after removing the last node, the switched node that was at the last moves downward to one of its children which is smaller than it in a min heap or greater than it in a max heap. It also occurs until the heap satisfies its heap property.

In a binary heap, those take in $O(log_2(n))$ where $n$ is the number of nodes.

**Quick Tip**: `Negation` can be used to turn a min heap into a max heap (or vice versa).
- Considering the implementation of a comparator:
  - Let $x$, $y$ be elements (that actually are numbers) in a min heap where $x$ comes before $y$ if $x \leq y$.
  - The negation of this is, if $x \geq y$, then $y$ comes before $x$.
	- An inequation (> or <) can be flipped by **the multiplication of -1**.
	- Flipping the result of comparing between two values is to turn the min heap into the max heap.
- Another alternative method for numbers is to negate the numbers as we insert them into a heap. And negate them again when they are taken out. This has the same effect as negating the comparator.
	- Remember that $x \leq y$ -> $-x \geq -y$.
- Suppose `lex` is a comparator for strings which sorts strings in lexicographic order (the default in most programming languages). Then let `nlex` be the negation of `lex`, and also let $s1$, $s2$ be strings.

| Result | Comparison |
|-|-|
| lex(s1, s2) = -1 | if s1 < s2 |
| lex(s1, s2) =  0 | if s1 = s2 |
| lex(s1, s2) = +1 | if s1 > s2 |
| nlex(s1, s2) = -1 | if s1 < s2 |
| nlex(s1, s2) =  0 | if s1 = s2 |
| nlex(s1, s2) = +1 | if s1 > s2 |

Getting back to the priority queue which is implemented with a heap, PQ operations actually do as like below.
- `peek()` reads the root node in a heap.
  - For the Min PQ, the root node is the smallest value in a min heap.
  - For the Max PQ, the root node is the greatest value in a max heap. 
- `poll()` removes the root node.
  - The root node will be swapped with the last one and removed.
  - Bubble down occurs until it satisfies the heap property. 
- `add()` enqueues a new node at the last and swims up until there is no violation of the heap property.

## When to use

1. Used in certain implementations of Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm.
2. Used to dynamically fetch the "next best" or "next worst" element.
3. Used in Huffman coding for lossless data compression.
4. Used in Best First Search algorithms such as A* to continuously grab the "next most promising node".
5. Used by Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms on direct graphs.

## Complexity

| Operation | Time |
|-|-|
| Construct | $O(n)$ |
| Peek | $O(1)$ |
| Poll | $O(log(n))$ |
| Remove | $O(log(n))$ |
| Add | $O(log(n))$ |
| (Naive) Remove | $O(n)$ |
| (Advanced) Remove with help from a hash table | $O(log(n))$ |
| (Naive) contain | $O(n)$ |
| Contain with help of a hash table | $O(1)$ |

- Building a priority queue takes linear time to set a heap as an array of length $n$.
- Polling and adding requires to satisfy the heap property by swimming up or sinking down.
- Removing a specific node takes logarithmic time (because of swimming up and sinking down),
  but a hash table can help optimize it by taking up linear space. But it adds some overhead to the binary heap implementation.
  - The inefficiency of the removal algorithm comes from the fact that we have to perform a linear search to find out where an element is indexed at.
    A hash table provides a constant time lookup and update for a mapping from a key (the node value) to a value (the index).
- For several same values in a heap, it can use a Set or TreeSet of indices for the mapping.

# Implementation

## Interface

Let's see a `PriorityQueue` class that is implemented with a binary heap.

<div>
{% plantuml %}
skinparam ClassAttributeIconSize 0
class PriorityQueue {
    -_size  :int
    -_capacity  :int
    -_heap  :list[object]
    -_map  :dict[object, int]
    -_comparator  :function
    -_add_map(object, int)  :None
    -_remove_map(object, int)  :None
    -_swap(int, int)  :None
    -_swim_up(int)  :None
    -_sink_down(int)  :None
    +peek()  :object
    +poll()  :object
    +add(object)   :None
    +remove(object)  :None
    +remove_at(int)  :object
    +contain(object)  :bool
    +is_empty()  :bool
    +size()  :int
    +clear()  :None
}
{% endplantuml %}
</div>

Here, this interface uses a dictionary as a hash table to immediately find an index at which each object positions. Objects are stored in an array, `_heap[]`. It is important to only put [hashable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable) objects into an array because it treats objects as keys in a dictionary. For a hash table, there are two auxiliary methods: `_add_map()` and `_remove_map()`. 

To `Heapify` that is the operation to keep the heap property, there are three private methods:
- `_swap()` is to exchange the positions of two nodes in our heap (plus our hash table).
- `_swim_up()` is to exchange the node at a given index and its parent node until the given node no longer has higher priority.
- `_sink_down()` is to exchange the node at a given index and one of its children until the given node no longer has lower priority.

Remind that this binary heap is an array where the index of a given node is $i$
- Parent node has an index of $(i-1)\div2$
- Left child node has an index of $(i*2)+1$
- Right child node has an index of $(i*2)+2$

Let's see three main operations: `_peek()`, `_poll()`, and `_add()`

Peeking the root node is just to return the first object in our heap.

Polling is to remove the root node by sinking down the last node that was switched with the root node
until there is no violation of the heap property.

{% highlight python linenos %}
class Priority Queue:
    # ...

    def poll(self) -> object:
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception("PriorityQueue is empty.")
        # Decrement the number of nodes.
        self._heap_size -= 1
        # Get the root node.
        root = self._heap[0]
        # Swap the root and the last nodes.
        self._swap(0, self._heap_size)
        # Remove the node at the last that is the root node.
        self._remove_map(root, self._heap_size)
        self._heap.pop()
        # Sink down the node at the first position.
        self._sink_down(0)
        # Return the old root node.
        return root

    # ...
{% endhighlight %}

Adding is to append a new object by swimming up the last node that is newly added
until there is no violation of the heap property.

{% highlight python linenos %}
class PriorityQueue:
    # ...

    def add(self, obj: object) -> None:
        # Append it to the end of our heap.
        self._heap.append(obj)
        # Add it into our hash table (Its key happens to be the last index + 1).
        self._add_map(obj, self._heap_size)
        # Swim up the node at the last position.
        self._swim(self._heap_size)
        # Increment the number of nodes. 
        self._heap_size += 1
        # Do doubling the capacity if the size exceeds it.
        if self._heap_size > self._heap_capacity:
            self._heap_capacity *= 2

    # ...
{% endhighlight %}

The time to use both `_swim_up()` and `_sink_down()` is when to remove a particular node in the middle of the heap.
