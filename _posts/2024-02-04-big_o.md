Big-Oh is defined as ...

it is pronounced as "Order" or "O of" or "Big O of"

## Big-Oh Properties

## When to use

It is used to measure the cost of an algorithm.

For iteration,

{% highlight python linenos %}
# It takes O(n)
def sum(n: int) -> int:
    _sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        _sum += i
    return _sum
{% endhighlight %}

For recursion,

{% highlight python linenos %}
# It takes O(n)
def sum(n: int) -> int:
    _sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        _sum += i
    return _sum
{% endhighlight %}

# Application

- O(1)
- O(N)
- O(N^2)
